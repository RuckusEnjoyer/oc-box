## Description

OC Box is an application that stores the information and images of my favorite original characters. When making this application, I firstly wanted a place where I had full creative control of my website's design, which would let me paint a better narrative of my character's story, his world, his alternate storylines, and how each story diverged. In the future, as I learn React, I plan to update this site to support uploading images. This will let me store my characters' images in a server, rather than have it only on my computer. I also plan to make minigames surrounding my character's story and interests - such as a solitaire game, or a rudimentary minesweeper. Keep in touch to see these updates!

## Installation

OC box does not need to be installed, it will be run on the website link below: 

## Usage
    
OC box will allow people to view my character's story all in one place. The homepage has three buttons, corresponding to my first character, Reck Callihan, my second character, Ruckus Lurray, and my third character, Cassiano  Monti. When you click on the images, you will be taken to the character's biography. There will be dropdowns where you can view their history, their trivia, their personality, and their interests. In the future, there will be themed minigames in some of these sections as well.
